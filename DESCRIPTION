Description: This package offers an implementation of the algorithms developed
  by Hansen, Lunde and Nason (2011). The authors introduce the notion of a model 
  confidence set (MCS) to account for the degree of uncertainty surrounding model
  selection. In analogy to confidence intervals for population parameters, 
  the MCS methodology estimates a set of models that is expected to contain 
  the best model(s) with a given probability.
